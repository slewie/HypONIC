# HypONIC -- Hyperparameter Optimization with Nature Inspired Computing

*HypONIC* is a hyperparameter optimization library that uses various nature inspired computing algorithms to optimize
the hyperparameters of machine learning models. The library provides a simple interface for sklearn and keras models.

## Features
*HypONIC* supports different nature inspired computing algorithms.
The following algorithms are currently implemented or are planned to be implemented:

**Swarm-based:**
- - [x] Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
- - [x] Inertia Weight PSO (IWPSO)
- - [ ] Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
- - [x] Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)
- - [ ] Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO)
- - [ ] Cuckoo Search (CS)
- - [ ] Firefly Algorithm (FA)

**Physics-based:**
- - [ ] Simulated Annealing (SA)

## Minimal Example

```python
# TODO: Add minimal example
